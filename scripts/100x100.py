# The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners, who are numbered 
# from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a cupboard with 100 drawers. 
# The director randomly puts one prisoner's number in each closed drawer. 
# The prisoners enter the room, one after another. Each prisoner may open 
# and look into 50 drawers in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards.
# If, during this search, every prisoner finds his number in one of the drawers, 
# all prisoners are pardoned. If just one prisoner does not find his number, all 
# prisoners die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may 
# discuss strategyâ€”but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to 
# look in the drawers. What is the prisoners' best strategy?
