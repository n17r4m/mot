exp 1 : 17 epochs of deep velocity on a now deleted database ..
        used continous pull from query processor to generate negatives.
        query processor ran out. Decent, but accuracy only ~50px
        
exp 2: uses method="Tracking_trainExp"
       31 epochs (to date). Now is possible to resume training. 
       negative batches are generated by permuting the batch.
       Still kind of wonky how this is performed.
       Still ~50px accuracy
       
exp 3: uses method="simulation_tracking"
