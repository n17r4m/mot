This DLL requires drivers installed with the Camera Control software, so that install process should be completed before using the DLL.

The Mega Speed AVI Player is also required to play back the AVI files saved by the Mega Speed cameras DLL.

This DLL additionally requires the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)" 
which is freely available from Microsoft if it is not already installed on your system.


The DLLExampleVS2010 project shows how to get started on development, so it is a good idea to review its code and readme file first.

The AVIReadDShow project shows how to read an AVI saved by the DLL and extract the frame timestamps and other information from it.
